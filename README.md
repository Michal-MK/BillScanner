Fetch OCR'd shopping bills from GDrive and get interesting information

## The plan

With this program you will be able to fetch documents from Google Drive that contain OCR text from an image that was taken by your smartphone.

#### Currently the best way I found is to:
##### With the Keep App
---
With your Smartphone
* Download [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en), [(IOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-keep/id1029207872?mt=8)
* Take a picture of the bill
---
At Home
* Open Google keep from browser (The app doesnt allow OCR -.-)
* OCR the bill and move it to Google Drive
* Run this program

##### Wthout Keep App
---
With your Smartphone
* Go to Google Keep and select "**_Show Desktop version_**"
* Take a picture of the bill
* OCR the bill and move it to Google Drive
---
At Home
* Run this program
